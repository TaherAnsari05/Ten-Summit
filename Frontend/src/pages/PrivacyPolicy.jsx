We have implemented physical, technical, and administrative security measures for the Services that comply with applicable laws and industry standards, as we further explain in our <a href="">Security Policy</a>.

        <p>Note that we cannot be held responsible for unauthorized or unintended access beyond our control, and we make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will always be able to prevent such access.</p>

    <h3>10) Cross-Border Data Transfer</h3>
        <p>We may store or process your Personal Data in a variety of countries including the United States.

Personal Data transferred from within the EU, the UK or Switzerland to ScyllaDB Inc., is subject to the DPF Principles, as all defined and detailed in the Data Privacy Framework Statement available here: <a href="">Data Privacy Framework</a> Your personal information may be transferred and stored in countries outside the EEA that are subject to different standards of data protection. We will take appropriate measures to ensure that your Personal Data receives an adequate level of data protection upon its transfer. When Personal Data collected within the European Economic Area (“<b>EEA</b>“) is transferred outside of the EEA to a country that has not received an adequacy decision from the European Commission, we will take necessary steps in order to ensure that sufficient safeguards are provided during the transferring of such Personal Data, in accordance with the provision of the <a href="">EU standard contractual clauses</a> approved by the European Union (SCCs). Additionally, following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union on January 31, 2020, the UK is no longer considered to be a part of the EEA and therefore, the transferring of Personal Data from the EEA to the UK is subject to and made pursuant with the <a href="">UK standard contractual clauses</a>. In addition to the standard contractual clauses mentioned above we are certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (“<b>DPF</b>”), the UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, and the Swiss-US DPF, which entered into force on July 10, 2023.
